      <h2>Homework Questions</h2>
      <p>Just going to answer the homework questions here...</p>
      <section>
        <h3>Question #1</h3>
        <p>Without using relative or absolute positioning, what is another way to organize elements on a page?</p>
        <p>My guess is using an inline style code or internal style sheet.</p>

        <h3>Question #2</h3>
        <p>Why did you chose this color scheme?</p>
        <p>I chose this color scheme because I wanted some color, but I did not want it to be annoying to look at. I thought these were pretty neutral colors to use but also colors you may not regularly see.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Why did you chose those images?</p>
        <p>I chose those images because I enjoy the aesthetic and play on retro Internet culture. I also feel like taking this web design class reminds me of those times where the Internet and web design was so free and limitless in the manner of creation. It was not necessarily subjected to much structure. You could make anything that represented you.

        <h3>Question #3</h3>
        <p>How would you rate this assignment?</p>
        <p>If I were to rate the assignment, I would rate it 5/5. It was easy and eno=joyable. I'm now seeing out the whole layout of a website comes together. If I had a lot more time on my hands, I would have edited the layout even further and tested out other codes, but I made due with the time I had and the information I had available.</p>
