<br><br><br><em><h1><u>Alignment</h1></em></u>

<br><br><h2><a href="https://usebites.com" style="color: #b45f06">Bites</a></h2></center>
<br>
<ul><li>Bites is a good example of alignment.</li>
	<li>The area that provides visuals for the types of popup they create for websites are put into a 3x10 column/row format.</li> 
	<li>They run straight across their placement on the webpage and are not purposely misaligned asymmetrically.</li>
</ul>

<br><br><br><em><h1><u>Contrast</h1></em></u>

<br><br><h2><a href="https://war.encharm.studio" style="color: #b45f06">Encharm</a></h2></center>
<br>
<ol><li>The Encharm website illustrates contrast with its use of differing type for its title and subtitle. It uses Montserrat for its title and Robot Slab for its subtitle.</li> 
	<li>The white color of the text is also in contrast to its dark red background.</li>
	<li>The immovable title and subtitle against its moving image of a background is another contrast.</li></ol>

<br><br><br><em><h1><u>Repetition</h1></em></u>
<br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/WyDmhQz/Screen-Shot-2022-10-02-at-10-42-18-AM.png" alt="image">
<br><br><h2><a href="https://www.culturalsolutions.co.uk" style="color: #b45f06">Cultural Solutions UK</a></h2></center>
<br>
<dl>Cultural Solutions clearly shows repetition. 
	<dt>Cultural Solutions UK website shows repetition through its use of many circles in its background design.</dt> 
	<dd>The circles vary in shape and opacity and can be found all over the webpage as you continue to scroll. Its logo and header icons also follow this shape.</dd>
<br><br><br><hr><center>
<br><br><br><em><h1><u>Proximity</h1></em></u>
<br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fpWF9Q1/Screen-Shot-2022-10-02-at-10-40-37-AM.png" alt="image">
<br><br><h2><a href="https://monyssb.com" style="color: #b45f06">Monty's</a></h2></center>
<br><center><p>Mony's website depicts <font color="#674ea7"> proximity </font> in the form of its background illustration.</p>
<br><p><font color="#FFFFF">The illustration itself uses the same line work between its differing depicted objects and as a result they are all grouped together to form the website background and theme. As you scroll further down you find its menu. The background is then limited to the outside border surrounded the black space which contains the menu text. This also shows proximity because the images are grouped to the outside border.</font></p>
